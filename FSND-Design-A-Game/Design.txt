#Reflect on Your Design

###What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

User:
In addition to the name and email, the User model now has the wins, total_games, and
win_percentage to track player's progress.

Score:
Add player_hand, computer_hand, and won to record game history and player winning scores.

###What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

In order to ensure the game logic and each endpoint is working property, I had to
repeatedly create new users, play a few games and hope to get the result I need (result is random).
It becomes trivial and frustrating at times, I should probably automate the testing process
at the beginning to make it more efficient.
